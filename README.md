Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Its the application of enginnering principles to the design, development,testing ,deployment and mantainance of software systems.
it is important in technology industry because its ensures quality,improves efficiency, supports scalability and its cost  effective as well

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction of structured programming in 1970s -encouraged modular code design, improving rradability and reducing errors
Advent of object orinted programming-introduced concepts like classes and inheritance making sofware more reusable 
Agile and DevOps Methodologies-shifted focus to iterative developments, automation and enhancing software speed and quality


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Plannig-defines projects scope,goals,bugdet and timeline
Requirement analysis-gathers and documents user and system requirements
Design- creates software architecture and systems components 
coding- developer writes and integrate coding 
Testig-indentifies and fixes bugs to ensure functionality and perfomance 
Deployment - releases software to the users
Mantainance- provides updates and fixes issues 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies uses linear and sequential approach, and each phase is completed before moving to the next wheres Agile methodolies are iterative and flexible, uses continous developments, testing and feedback loops.
In Waterfall methodologies its difficult to make changes once phase is completed and its deliverd at the end of the project. Agile methodoligies on the other hand is hoghly adaptable, changes can be made anytime and its deliverd in small icreaments 
Waterfall is used in Projects with clear, fixed requirements such as building a  banking system or developing military software. Agile is suitable for projects requiring flexibility like mobile app developments where requirements frequently change 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sofware Developer- writes ,tests and mantains codes. translates requirements into a functional software. fixes bugs 
Quality Assurance Engineer - designs and executes test cases. identifes and reports software defects and ensures software meets quality standards before release.
Projects Manager- plans, cordinates and monitors projects progress,manages team communications and resource allocation.Ensures projects meets deadlines and business objectives 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides tools for writing , debigging and testing code in one platform examples are Visual Studio, Pycharm and elipse
VCS tracks and manages changes in a code, enabling collaboration and rollback to previous versions.prevents conflicts when mutiple developers work on the same project, examples are Apache subversions and Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging complex issues-use systematic debugging techniques , logging and debugging tools 
Managing tight deadlines- use agile methodologies, prioritize tasks,break work into managable sprints.
keeping up with rapidly changing technologies- Engage in continous learning online courses and coding challenges 
Security Risks and Cyber Threats- follow secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits and  stay updated on vulnerabilities

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing-tests individual components to ensure they work correctly. its important because it catches the bugs early making debugging easier.
Integration Testing-tests how different modules interact with each other. it ensures smooth communicatuion between components 
System testing- tests the complete  software as a whole. its important because it verifies overall functionality and performance 
Acceptance testing- Validates whether the software meets the users requirements. Ensures the product is ready for deployment and satisfies the customer needs 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt enginnering is the process of crafting effective prompts (questions or instruction)  to get accurate, relevantand high quality responses from AI models
its important to interact with AI models  because: it improves response accuracy-well structrured prompts leads to more precise and meaningful AI outputs 
Enhances AI efficiency-reduces ambiguity and minimizes the need of re asking or re defining the queries 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt "Explain Python"
Improved Prompt "Describe the key features of programming language and its common use cases in data sciences in not more than 200 words"
the improved prompt specifies the key focus on key features and use cases in datas science leading to more targeted and relevant reponse
